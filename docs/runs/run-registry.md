# StateGuard3R Run Registry

This registry records setup attempts and experiments that materially affect the
initial feasibility decision. Large logs and outputs stay in the repository that
produced them and are not committed here.

## Setup record

### SETUP-0001: Pin the official ReCal3R baseline

- Time: 2026-07-31 19:00–19:28 CST
- Operator: Codex
- Target: `/data/wangzheng/Project2/baselines/ReCal3R`
- Official remote: `https://github.com/Powertony102/ReCal3R.git`
- Pinned commit: `466c7cdf3acd2f589f1d82e5f6391966f19db9ff`
- Branch: `main`
- Result: success

Actions and observations:

1. A direct HTTPS clone was attempted first and failed with
   `GnuTLS recv error (-110)`; it left no target directory.
2. A clean, `wangzheng`-owned local official clone at
   `/data/wangzheng/iJCV-CODE/ReCal3R` was used only as the source for a new
   Project2 working clone.
3. The new clone's `origin` was reset to the official GitHub URL.
4. `git fetch origin main` succeeded and the working copy was fast-forwarded
   from `2b920d3f` to the pinned official commit above.
5. Final `git status --short --branch` was clean and matched `origin/main`.

No dataset, checkpoint, environment, or GPU task was created during this setup.
